//! The `description` module contains definitions of `ToolDescription`s which is a datatype that
//! represents a Model Context Protocol (MCP) Tool Description. An MCP Tool description is a JSON
//! object that gives the name of the tool, an optional description of the tool, and a description of
//! the input and output parameters of the tool (and any type definitions usded to define these parameters).
//!
//! This module also includes a parser that deserializes an MCP tool description JSON into a `ToolDescription` struct.
//!
//! This module also includes a `ServerDescription` struct that represents a collection of MCP tool descriptions
//! (i.e., the output of `list_tools` from an MCP Server).
